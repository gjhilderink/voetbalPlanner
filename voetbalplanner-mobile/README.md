# FlutterFlow AI Workspace

This workspace is scaffolded for the FlutterFlow AI DSL.

## Quickstart

```bash
dart pub get
flutterflow ai test
flutterflow ai validate dsl/create.dart
flutterflow ai run dsl/create.dart --project-name "My App" --commit-message "Initial app"
```

Treat `flutterflow ai validate` as a real preflight check. If it reports wiring or validation failures, fix them before attempting `flutterflow ai run`.

If a new-project `flutterflow ai run` fails before a successful push, FlutterFlow AI will not bind that project into `.flutterflow/workspace.json`. It also does not delete remote projects automatically, so use `--find-or-create` on a retry when you want to reuse a project that may already exist.

For an existing project:

```bash
flutterflow ai inspect <project-id> --page HomePage
flutterflow ai validate dsl/edit.dart --project-id <project-id>
flutterflow ai run dsl/edit.dart --project-id <project-id> --commit-message "Update existing app"
```

## Files

- `dsl/create.dart`: starter create DSL file
- `dsl/edit.dart`: starter edit flow
- `test/app_test.dart`: starter compile test
- `references/`: working DSL examples copied locally into the workspace
- `patterns/`: edit helper patterns
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`: project summary for bound edit workspaces
- `context/`: expanded project details written by FlutterFlow AI context generation
- `generated_code/`: local Flutter export snapshot when `flutterflow_cli` is available during `flutterflow ai init --project <id>`
- `.flutterflow/` (SDK-managed: run artifacts, plus router-managed config): local runtime artifacts such as history, traces, and support outputs

## Edit Context

- `flutterflow ai init --project <id>` writes `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` when credentials are available.
- After the first successful push from a new unbound workspace, FlutterFlow AI also exports `generated_code/` when `flutterflow` CLI is available.
- Treat `generated_code/` as read-only reference context. Use it to inspect generated structure and map generated files back to FlutterFlow entities.
- Do not edit files in `generated_code/` directly. Apply changes in FlutterFlow AI-managed source such as `dsl/edit.dart`, then push with `flutterflow ai run`.
- If a task starts from a generated Dart file, use that file to identify the relevant page, component, or resource, then make the change through FlutterFlow AI instead of patching generated output.
- After a successful FlutterFlow AI push, `generated_code/` is marked stale instead of silently treated as current.
- Run `flutterflow ai codegen status` to see whether the snapshot is fresh or stale and which entities/files are likely affected.
- Run `flutterflow ai codegen refresh` to regenerate `generated_code/` for the bound project when you need a fresh snapshot.
- Run `flutterflow ai refresh-context <project-id>` after meaningful remote changes.
- Run `flutterflow ai context-check` if you are not sure whether local context is current.
- Use `flutterflow ai inspect` and `flutterflow ai resources` for exact current page, component, and resource details.
- Use `flutterflow ai inspect --dsl-json`, `--tree`, `--outline`, `--debug`, or `--deep` when you need a specific inspection mode rather than the default whole-project summary.
- Use `flutterflow ai inspect --selector-path <path>` or `--selector-key <key>` (with `--page` or `--component`) to target a single widget directly.

## FlutterFlow AI Selector Workflow

When the user pastes a `FlutterFlow AI Selector v1` block:

```
FlutterFlow AI Selector v1
project_id: abc123
scope_kind: page
scope_name: HomePage
selector_path: HomePage.body[0].children[1]
node_key: xyz789
node_name: MyButton
node_type: Button
```

1. Run: `flutterflow ai inspect abc123 --page HomePage --selector-path "HomePage.body[0].children[1]" --dsl-json`
2. Verify the returned widget matches expectations.
3. Patch with `findByPath(...)` in `dsl/edit.dart`:
   ```dart
   app.editPage('HomePage', (page) {
     page.findByPath('HomePage.body[0].children[1]').update((patch) {
       // modify properties
     });
   });
   ```
4. Run `flutterflow ai test`, `flutterflow ai validate`, `flutterflow ai run`.

## Guardrails

- When a page or component contains multiple backend actions with outputs, set `outputAs:` explicitly on each one. This is especially important for multiple `ApiCall(...)` actions on the same page or trigger.
- Prefer updating an existing edit trigger chain instead of adding a second API call to the same trigger unless both outputs are deliberately named.
- Size loading indicators explicitly. Use `ProgressBar.circular(size: 40, thickness: 4)` rather than the unsized default.
- Avoid `shrinkWrap: true` on dynamic `ListView(...)` widgets unless the list truly must live inside another scrollable. Prefer giving the list bounded space and leaving shrink wrap off.

## Runtime Artifacts

- `.flutterflow/runs.jsonl`: local run history
- `.flutterflow/history/<run-id>/`: archived source files and plan
- `.flutterflow/traces/<run-id>.json`: canonical run trace
- `flutterflow ai history`, `flutterflow ai trace latest`, and `flutterflow ai support inspect <run-id>` are the main debugging entry points

## Source Tracking

FlutterFlow AI keeps the source that produced each run for auditability and replay.

- By default, `flutterflow ai run dsl/create.dart` or `flutterflow ai run dsl/edit.dart` tracks the executed DSL script.
- `flutterflow ai support bundle`, `flutterflow ai support replay`, and `flutterflow ai support case` build shareable or reproducible artifacts from traced runs.
